# Bike Price Prediction App (Streamlit + FastAPI)

✔ `streamlit_app.py` → UI  
✔ `main.py` → Backend API  
✔ `catboost_bike_model.pkl` → trained AI/ML model  
✔ `bikes.csv` → dataset

### Deploy on Streamlit:
1. Upload entire folder to GitHub
2. On Streamlit Cloud select `streamlit_app.py` as the entry file
3. Add backend URL in Streamlit Secrets (`backend_url`)

If hosting FastAPI backend on Streamlit is not possible → deploy backend to Render/Railway and update `backend_url`.
